Lost Bit
=======

my first platform game. Developed using the Phaser framework. This is my first game and the reason for creating the repository is to try to use github and understand how to use and share my work.


Game Summary:
=======

Combining several distinct styles of gameplay, The Lost Bit is an adventure with elements of maze, roguelike, puzzle, and arcade survival games. Players will be thrust into a cute, yet thrilling story involving a monitor pixel’s battle to save its partner from a tyrannical computer virus. The story is depicted via high resolution illustrations between each level. The game opens with Pixel flying through the computer bus on a jetpack. For players, this results in a high speed surival challenge akin to games like Flappy Bird. The next level has players search for an object, a USB stick, with a randomized location. This location will change with each session. Collecting the object will initiate a Simon Says-esque memory game, of which failure to complete will result in the USB stick’s location being randomized again. Success in the game will allow players to proceed to the next level, a fight against the computer virus. This fight will challenge player’s reflexes and ability to predict trajectory.


Setting up the game:
=======
1. Download the file
2. Set up a local host which you can do in a number of ways one of which is the MAMP or WAMP application, another way is by using the Bucket aplication (text editor) where all you have to do is open the file and the launch it using the electric bolt icon. and finally by using python local host (which I recommend because it's the most reliable outcome which you can do by First, launching the terminal.
